## Visit
When my portfolio is ready, it should be accessible under the following link: [a36.dev](https://a36.dev)

## Introduction
Before applying for an internship, I wanted to create a web portfolio first. That's why I created this repository. Here you should find the creation process of my website.

My aim is to create a simple website where you can find all the information quickly. The website should also be responsive and work on current devices. (great browser support, apart from Internet Explorer).


## How it's made
The project was created with HTML, SCSS and JavaScript. 
No JavaScript libraries were used. My ambition was to create a fast website, so I did not want to download unnecessary files. As an alternative to this, I also planned a loader.

## Mockup
My Mockup ideas can be viewed at the following links. You can also download my Adobe XD template in which the design was created.
